Vocal cords: kind of like a throat butt
All speech is basically throat farting

utterance - word, couple of words, sequence of spoken language a computer can understand
phonemes - the sounds that we use
monophones - the 'a' in "bad" vs "ban"
most use triphones

5-10 ms of speech => fourier transformation (sound to amplitude and frequency) (split into its constiutuent sin waves)
