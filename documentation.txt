Commit message

What
  How (less necessary, more fluff)
    Why

*Why* style of commits instead of *what
    Demonstrate a goat message (what)
  vs.
    Enable a user to write a new goat message (why)

Picture the context and the likely user(s) (even if that's just future you)

Practice:
  - Write install instructions, have a fellow developer try and followthem
  - update a readme

Conversational documentation is *awesome*
